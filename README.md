Stock fusion is an IOS app to track changes on prices of stock on the stock market and send the user notifications if there are changes on the value of the said stock being tracked.

For historical data on a selected stock, this is available on graph ploted for closing, up and down prices for the stock for last 3 years.

A user must sign up before they can track a stock, otherwise they have the ability to view all stocks available
(api data is pulled from www.worldtradingdata.com/), and for now users in Vancouver BC can view a selected number of stock exchange houses using the HD Augmented reality tab, they'll need to have their GPS location active too to be able to have a better experience.

The backend used for this app is NoSQL (Firebase) to manage user registration and saving of data to a real-time database.
